# SecBuilds
Scripts to install security tools from source in Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop.

**Note:** These are NOT unattended installs. You may have to enter your sudo password or make a selection here and there, so don't just start them and walk away. The GVM installation takes quite a while, so at least check in with it here and there.

You can just download the files, or if you'd like to clone the repository on your Ubuntu 22.04 Desktop system (or VM) you can install git:
